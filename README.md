# Uniform, random sampling: what's the current status?

 Large study and results of different SAT-based samplers:
 * KUS https://github.com/meelgroup/KUS (new!)
 * SPUR https://github.com/ZaydH/spur (new!) 
 * Unigen2 and QuickSampler https://github.com/diverse-project/samplingfm/
 
 over different data:
 * https://github.com/diverse-project/samplingfm/ (including SAT formulas and hard feature models)
 * https://github.com/PettTo/Feature-Model-History-of-Linux (new!)
 
 Requirements:
  * Docker image with Python 3, pandas, numpy 
  * solvers above and a proper installation 
  * time and resources ;)
